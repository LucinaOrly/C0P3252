// 3.15(RemovingDuplicatedCodeinMethodmain)Inthe AccountTest class of Fig. 3.9 , method main contains six statements (lines 11–12, 13–14, 26–27, 28–29, 38–39 and 40–41) that each display an Account object’s name and balance. Study these statements and you’ll notice that they differ only in the Account object being manipulated—account1 or account2. In this exercise, you’ll define a new displayAccount method that contains one copy of that output statement. The method’s parameter will be an Account object and the method will output the object’s name and balance. You’ll then replace the six duplicated statements in main with calls to displayAccount, passing as an argument the specific Account object to output.
Modify class AccountTest of Fig. 3.9 to declare method displayAccount (Fig. 3.20 ) after the closing right brace of main and before the closing right brace of class AccountTest. Replace the comment in the method’s body with a statement that displays accountToDisplay’s name and balance.
