// 8.5
// (Modifying the Internal Data Representation of a Class) It would be
// perfectly reasonable for the Time2 class of Fig. 8.5 to represent  time
// internally, as the number of seconds since midnight rather than the three
// integer values hour, minute and second. Clients could use the same public
// methods and get the same results. Modify the Time2 class of Fig. 8.5 to
// implement the time as number of seconds since midnight and show that no
// change is visible to the clients of the class.
//
// [Note: For Excercise 8.5, also include your modified version of Figure 8.6;
// i.e., include all files needed to run your program.]
