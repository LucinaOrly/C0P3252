// 8.8
// (Enhancing Class Date) Modify class Date of Fig. 8.7 to perform error checking on the initializer values for variables month, day and year (currently it validates only the month and day). Provide a method nextDay to increment the day by one. Write a program that tests method nextDay in a loop that prints the date during each iteration illustratethat the method works correctly. Test the following cases:
// 1. incrementing into the next month and
// 2. incrementing into the next year.
